# Fillit
This is the story of a piece of Tetris, one little square and a dev walk into a bar...

The purpose is to make the smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes) with a given list of tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from the top left.

# Compiling
Run "make", an executable called "fillit" should compile directly. Please submit an issue if you run into any.

# Usage
./fillit [file]
